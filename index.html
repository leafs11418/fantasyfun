        <h1>Luke's Fantasy Rankings - Super 8</h1>
        <p>This site will be used to display my player rankings for the 2022 NFL season. Super 8's scoring settings are listed below.</p>
        <p>After years of disappointing playoff performances, I decided I need more stability in my scoring. This year, I will be drafting players not just by the overall expected output, but also by the range of their weekly scores.</p>
        <p>I decided to use <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range' target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interquartile range (IQR)</a> over standard deviation since I felt the sample size for each player was small and outlier performances could heavily skew the data.</p>
        <h3>The process:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Using Python (pandas, Beautiful Soup), scrape weekly player stats for 2019-2021 and create dataframe</li>
            <li>Apply league's scoring settings to track fantasy scoring</li>
            <li>Calculate players' average weekly fantasy score and their IQR</li>
            <li>Sort players by average weekly fantasy score (descending) and then by IQR (ascending)</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Scoring Settings</h3>
